representution of the tool, while a real environment involves actual interaction with the physicul tool. Virlualenvironrments have the advaniage of being easily accessible and replicable, allowing for mure cost-efleclivetraining for moclels. However, virtual environments may not fully replicate the complexities of the real-worldenvirnrnrment,leading to overlinning and poor generalization(Hansen et al.2021). On the cther hand,realenvironrments provile a more realistic context but may be more challenging to acoess and involve greater costs.  
Controller. The controller C' serves as the "brain" for tool learning framework and is typically modeled usinga foundation moxlel.The purpose of the controller C is to provide a feasible and precise plan for using toolsto fulfill the user's request. To this end. C should understand user intent as well as the relationship betweenthe intent and available tools and then develop a plan to select the appropriate tools for tackling lasks, whichwill he discussed in 83.2.1.In cases where the query is complex and targets a high-level task, C may need todecompose the task into multiple sub-tasks, which requires foundational models to have powerful planningandreasoning capabilitics(ÂêÑ3.2.2).  
Perceiver.The perceiver P is responsible for processing the user's and the environment's feecdback andgenerating a summary for the controller. Simple forms of foedback processing include concatenating the userand environment feedhack or formatting the foedback using a pre-defined template. The summarized feedhackis then passed to the controller to assist its decision-making. By observing this feedback, the controllercan determine whether the generated plan is cffoctive and whether there are anomalics during the exccutionthat need to be addressed. Under more complex scenarios, the perceiver should be able to support multiplernodalities, such as text, vision, and audio, to capture the diverse nature of feedback from the user and theenvironment  
## 3.1.2 Connecting the Components  
Formally assurme we have a tool set T, which the controller can utilize to accomplish certain tasks. At timestep t, environment 2 provides feouback ca on the tool execution. The perceiver  roceives the user feedbackf and the environment feedhack o, and generates surmmarized feedhack a.Typically, the perceiver can heachieved hy pre-defined rules (e.g.,concatenating Jt and e)to form ar, or nedeled with complex neuralmodels.The controller C generates a plan as, which selects and executes an appropriate tool from T. Thisprocess can he formulated as the following probability distribution:  
Fe(a)=2o=[o|=.11a.0),
