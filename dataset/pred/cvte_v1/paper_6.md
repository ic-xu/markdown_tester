## 1. Introduction  
Recently. RNA interference (RNA) technolagy has become aprormising strategy for the treatment of major diseases, suchas cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative dis-eases, etc. INapoli et al,1990: Guo et al, 2010;Kapoor et al,2012: Kim et al,2016:Lee et al,2016]. However, due to theexistence of abundant RNase and the stability problem ofRNA, including degradation during transport and transfertion, RNAi-based agents are easily inactivated during systernic circulation; an the other side, the safe and effectivedelivery of RNAi agents, such as siRNA to target cells andefficient release into cytoplasm, still remains major hurdle forthe clinical application of therapeutic RNAs, including siRNAsVerma & Somia. 1997].Therefore, it is critical to diesign and  
develop effective RNA delivery vehicles for the dlinical trials  
of RNAi therapeutics.Gene delivery vectors are commonly categorized into viraland non-viral vectors (lbraheem et al,2014). Compared withviral vectors, non-viral vectors are less immunogenicity,easypreparation, lower cost, and higher gene encapsulation cap-ability: all these acvantages make them attractive tools forgene therapy iKanasty et al.2013). In the development ofnon-viral vectors,poly(amidoamine)(PAMAM) is an ideal candidate with high gene transfection efficiency. Because of theterminal amino groups. PAMAM molecules are positivelycharged at physiological pH environment, which could interact with the negatively charged phosphate groups of RNAsSMoreover,amine-terminated PAMAM also shows an ability to

promote endosomal escape of loaded agents via 'protonsponge' effect, which could protect genes from lysosomaldegraclation and further enhance transfection efficiency(Shen et al,2010). However, due to the high positive chargeon the surface,the toicity profile of PAMAM is still a majorproblem limiting its preclinical research and clinical applications lLee et al.2009: Mukherjee et al,2010]. In order toreduce the toxicity of PAMAM, surface modification andiorcation block strategies are very much required Waite et al.2009:Jin et al,2011;Chang et al,2017; Li et al.2021).However, as the membrane potential of cells is usually negative, the decrease of the surface positive charge of vectorswould lead to reduced cellular uptake and gene transfection  
efficiency (liang et al.20091.Stimuli-triggered dis-shielding strategies have attracted enormous interest and boosted intense studies to improve the safetyof PAMAM and reclox-triggered dis-shielding is one of them,which is highly valued in cancer treatrment. Compared with nor-mal cells, most tumor cells exhibit higher levels of reactive oxy-gen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSHI. it has been repartedthat the concentration of GSH in cancer cells 12-10mMl wasmuch higher than that in normal cells (2-20 uM) (Fang et al,2009.Du et al.2020; Li et al,2021]. This unique redox environ-ment of turnor allows the breakage of redox sensitive bands, forexample, disulfide bonds or diselenide bands, to release loadedcargoes (Shen et al,2010:Yin et al,2016: Li et al.2021). Morerecently, diselenide bonds have emerged as attractive bio-signalsensitive linkage.Similar as disulfide bonds, diselenide bandscould be cleaved at tumor-relevant redox ervironment Ma et al,2010:Sun et al,2017]. In addition, block copolymers containingdiselenicle bands also have y-ray response capabilities, indicatingthat the diselenide boncs can be used to combine chemother-apy and radiotherapy ICao et al, 20131, and it is also reportedthat selenium compounds can help treatment of COVD-19(Kieliszek & Lipins/o,2020)  
Because of the safety problem of PAMAM associated withpositive charges on the surface, we designed and synthesized aredox-sensitive anionic block copolymer to solve the biosafetylimitation of PAMAM dendrimer. In the present study.PAMAMdendrimer was used to load siRNA (siR-93CDPAMAMI, and thediselenice bonds-modified hyaluronic acid(HA) derivative wasconstructed (HA-SeSe-COOH) to conjugate with cationic siR.93CePAMAM via electrostatic interaction OHA-SeSe-COOH/sIR-93CePAMAMI for the positive charge shielding. In order toachieve effective intracellular siRNA delivery ishown in Scheme11. In vitro efficacy of the hyorid complex was investigated bymanitaring particle size, stability cytotoxicity,uptake mechan-ism. lysosomal escape ability, transfectian efficiency and cellcycle arrest on A549 (KRAS mutation human lung carcinomacells.Furthermore, in viwo perfomances, such as in vivo distribu-tion, turmar progressian inhibition and biacompatibility, werealso evaluated an A549 tumor-bearing mice.

this work the ideal N/P ratio was 10  
Under this N/P ration, the particle size of constructed siR93C@PAMAMM complex was 149nm (PDI= 0.114, and thezeta potential of complex was +24.7 mV ishown in Figure2(B)).Further, in order to reduce the surface positive chargeto improve the stability of siRNA during blood circulation,HA-SeSe-COOH was introduced as the outer shell to coverthe inner core siR-93C@PAMAM, at the same time, the particle size of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM would beincreased also. To optimize the employed amount of HASeSe-COOH, different mass ratios of HA-SeSe-COOH to siR93C@PAMAM were tested between 0.2/1 and 4/1.The par-ticle size results are shown in Table 1. It was found thatwhen the ratio was from 0.6/1 to 1.2/1, there was no nanoassociation complex constructed in the system, this may becaused by the random aggregation of siR-93CaPAMAM andHA-SeSe-COOH when the zeta potential of mixture close tozero. On the other sice, the amount of HA-SeSe-COOH couldnot only affect the stability of complex, but also affect thesurface charge and particle size of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-g3CaPAMAM. It was found that when the HA-SeSe-COOHwas less than siR-93CePAMAM,the zeta potential of complexwas positively charged even the particle size could be similar  
electrophoresis, indicating that siRNA was fully loaded. Thus, in to each other. For example, when the mass ratio of HA-SeSeCOOH to siR-93CePAMAM was 0.3/1 and 3/1, complexeswith similar particle size (197nm and 181nm,respectively)would be obtained, however, the zeta potential was mark-edly different, positive complex [+12.4 mv) was constructedwhen the ratio was D.3/1 compared with negatively chargedcomplex (-24.6mv) with the ratio of 3/1.Considering theissue of bialogical safety which will be discussed in the nextsectionj, the ratio of 3/1 was used in the following studywhich the siRNA-loading efficiency was 3.239. The morphology of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM iwith the ratio of3/1. was observed by TEM to further obtain the nanostructure information. TEM image (Figure 21CI) showed that HASeSe-COOH/siR-93CePAMAM was spherical particle with theobvious nano structure

However, theparticle size of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CaPAMAM began toincrease slowly under low concentration of GSH or ROSwhich was due to the reclox-responsive cleavage of diselenide bonds. When the GSH or RO5 level was improved, theparticle size increased dramatically, indicating the dissociation of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CBPAMAM. Mareover,giventhe intracellular RO5 and GSH level of cancer cells, theresponsive dissociation ability of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CoPAMAM could enable protection and stability duringblood circulation and efficient release of siR-93C@PAMAM atthe turnor site  
expected, the cytotoxicity of HA-SeSe-COOH/SINCOPAMANwas significantly reduced by Increasing amount of HA-SeSeCOOH, indicated that the shell of HA-SeSe-COOH would considerably enhance the biocompatibility of PAMAM. When thesiNC was 100 nM,the survival of A549 cells was still 81.59h inHA-SeSe-COOH/siNC@PAMAM(3/1) group, which was obviously higher than that of 65.2% in HA-5eSe-COOHSiNC@PAMAM (0.3/1)group and 49.595 siNCePAMAMTherefore, HA-SeSe-COOH/siNCGPAMAM (3/1) was selectedin the following study. The in vitro cytotoxicity results suggested that PAM.AM cytotoxicity can be reduced by the HAderivate shell.  
3.5. Cellular uptake pathway investigation  
## 3.4. In vitro cytotoxicity  
To investigate the in vitro cytotoxicity of different nanocomplexes. siNC was used to avoid the interference of siR-93C. invitro cytotoxicity of various concentrations of siNCePAMAMand HA-SeSe-COOH/sINGaPAMAM was evaluated by MTTassay in A549 cells. From Figure 31A) it could be found thatthe cytotoxicity of both siNCaPAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOHsiNCePAMAM was concentration dependent. Compared withHA-SeSe-COOH/siNCOPAMAM the cytotoxicity ofsiNCPAMAM is cenerally higher at the same siNC concen-tration, which was due to electrostatic attraction betweennegatively charged cell mernbrane and positively chargedsiNCePAMAM under physiological conditions as the extensive number of amino groups on the surface of PAMAM. As  
The cellular uptake pathway of nanocomplex plays a criticalrole in the final transfection efficacy. In this study, severalendocytosis inhibitors were used to investigate the endocytosis pathway of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93COPAMAM. andFAM-labeled siR-93C was introduced for the internalizationInvestigation. As shown in Figure 3(B],Chlorpromazine treatment showed significant effect in the cellular uptake of complex, with the cellular uptake of siR-93C loaded complex wasreduced to 47.8695, which was much lawer than that of MD-CD treated group icellular uptake wasstill7723961.indicating that HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CPAMAM was mainly internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway.Thiscellular uptake mechanism results were similar to our previous study (Li et al,2021]. Moreover,less HA-SeSeCOOH/siR93CBPAMAM was detected when the CD44 receptor was

## 3.6. Lysosomal escape  
## 3.7.Transfectionbehaviorof HA-SeSe-COOH/SIR-93C=PAMAM  
It is well known that the internalized RNA andfor drugs areeasily degraded by lysosome enzymes,such as acid RNasesand exonucleases, resulting in reduced anti-cancer efficacy(Huang et all,20201.Thus, lysosomal escape ability of siRNAloaded complex is crucial for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy. The lysosomal escape ability study was investigatedusing confocal laser scanning microscope(CLSM). From theCLSM images (showm in Figure 3iC)l, the yellow signal.over-lap area of red fluorescence (lysosome) and green fluorescence igreen fluarescent FAM labeled sif-93C1, indicated thatsiR-93C was trapped in lysosomer after siR-93C escaped fromlysosome, bright cyan fluorescence could be observed fromCLSM image, also the separation of green fluorescence withred regian was detected ishown in Figure S1]. In siR-93C@Lipo2000 group,siR-93C was mainly present in the lysosome at 2h. Alchough there was slight cyan fluorescence sig-nal could be observedl at 4h, the stronger yellow signalindicated that most of the siRNA was still localized in lyso-some until 8h. In the siR-93C@PAMAM andHA-SeSe-COOH/sif-93C@PAMAM groups. a fast and effective bysosomalescape could be observed at even 2h as the cyan signal wasclearly observed from CLSM indicating the spread out of thesiR-93C from lysosome. The effective lysosomal escape abilitywas accounted by the proton sponge effect' of PAMAM.Though the HA-SeSe COOH shell may affect the efficiency oflysosome escape, the GSH-responsive disassembly of the  
Luciferase activity assay was performed to investigate thetransfection efficiency ofHA-SeSe-COOH/siR 93CDPAMAM.Asshown in Fiqure 4[Al, the results showed that the transfection efficiency was improved when increasing the siRNA concentration, all the group showed the highest transfectianefficiency when the siR-93C concentration was improved to100nM, which was almost 2-fold as compared to 10 nlM.Surprisingly,luciferase expression in siR-93COPAMAM,HASeSe-C0OH/siR-93CePAMAM(0.3/1)and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR93CcPAMAM(3/1) was no significant difference. It has beenfound that the positively charged particles strongly interactwith cells and penetrate into the cells more effectively thannegatively charged particles.In this study.siR-93CaPAMAMand HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CPAMAM (0.3/1) were positivelycharged.whereasthe HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CDPAMAM(3/1)was obviously negatively charged. The possible explanationfor transfection result was that the penetration ability of HASeSeCOOH/siR-93COPAMAM (3/1) into A549 cells could beImproved by the hyaluronic acild -derivative shell,as hyaluronic acid could specifically bind to CD44 which was overexpressed on A549 cells surface(Cano et al,2020).  
## 3.8.Cell migration and invasion in vitro  
Compared to other turnor cells, strong invasiveness and highmigration ability were observed in A549 cells. Thus, the  

582D.CHEN ET AL  
HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CePAMAM were evaluated.  
3.8.7. Wound healing assay  
In order to study the migration ability of A549 cells trans-fected by siR-93C/Lipo2000, wound scratches were abservedand rmeasured every 12h after transfection. As shown inFigure 4(B,C1, the cells in Control group displayed the stron-gest migration ability, and the siNC@Lipo2000 also exhibitedobvious healing trend, whereas the siNCePAMAM, siR93C@PAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM groupsshowed obvious inhibitory effects of migration. At 72h thewound scratch ratio of the control group was 56.7%, whereasthe wound scratch ratios of the siR-93CBPAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CPAMAM groups were still 84.795 and92.69%, respectively. The relative larger wound size in HA-SeSe-COOH/siH-93CaPAMAM group indicated the strongerability of inhibiting A549 cells migration,which was due tothe successful delivery and effective expression of siRNA inthe cells  
3.8.2.Transwell assayTranswell migration assay was also performed to furtherinvestigate the anti-invasive effects in A549 cells after thesiR-93C transfection (Figure 4(D.EN. It can be seen that thecells still exhibited strong invasive ability in the Controlgroup,siNC group and HA-SeSe-COOH/siINCOPAMAM group.Nevertheless, the number of cells passing through the  
inhibitory capacity of migration and invasion of A549 cells by chamber in the siNC@PAMAM. siR 93CgPAMAM and HASeSe-COOH/siR-93CePAMAM groups were dramaticallydecreased, with ratios were only 74.59%. 52.7%,and 35.2%,respectively. It should be noted that the number of penetrated cells in the siNCePAMAM group was relatively lowerthan other groups, which was related to the cytotoxicity ofPAMAM itself.The Transwell cell invasionresults showed thatSiRNAtransfectionviaHA-SrSe-COOH/siR-93CerPAMAM deliyery could decrease the invasion ability of A549 cells.  
## 3.9. Cycle arrest and apoptosis  
The results of above experiments confirmed that HA-SeSeCOOH/siR-93CePAMAM did exhibit antitumor ability. Herethe inhibit effect in prolferation of A549 cells was furtherassessed, and flow cytometry was used to evaluate the cyclearrest and cell apoptosis of A549 cells ishow in Figure5[A-D)). In the turnor cell cyclearrest analysis (Figure 5IA,B).cormpared with the control group the propartion of G1-phase cells was 48.996j,the proportion of G1-phase cells inthe HA-SeSe COOH/siR-93CPAMAM group was 72.2%which proved that HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM couldinduce G1-phase cell cycle arrest in A549 cells.Meanwhile.the proportions ofS-phase cells in siR-93C@Lipo2000.siR93CePAMAM,and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CaPAMAM groupswere 26.8,24.76, and 20.49%,respectively.Inthecellapoptosisanalysis results IFigure 5.C.Dl.com

(16.646). Meanwhile, both siR-93C@PAMAM and HA-SeSeCOOH/siR-93C@PAMAM exhibited more powwerful ability ofinducing cellapoptosis(11.03 and 27.79%] than siR-93C@Lipo2000 (6.4046]. Surprisingly.HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM exhibited stronger ability of inducing early cellapoptosis than siR-93CPAMAM [2.709]. These results fur-ther confirrned that the HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CePAMAMexhibited better siRNA transfection ability and can be appliedfor siRNA anti-turnor therapy.  
## 3.10.Western blotting analysis  
In orcer to further explore the molecular mechanism of A549cellapoptosisinducedbyHA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CgPAMAMcomplex, western blotting was performed to analyze theKRAS expression level inA549 cells after HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM transfection.Through Western blat analysis finFigure 5(E.F), the expression level of KRA5 could heobserved obviously decreased after the treatment with HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM complex, compared with thecontrol group, the expression of KRA5 decreased to 69.5% at24h and further decreased to 85.3% at 48h, the knockdownof KRAS would contribute to the inhibition of A549 cellsproliferation  
In the in vitro study, siR-93C was transferred into A549cells by HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM, and the gene-silencing effect was evaluated by Western blotting assay. Asshown in Figure 51E,FI,HA-SeSe-COOH/SiR-93CGPAMAMtreated group showed significant downregulation of theexpression level of KRAS protein, which showed that the HASeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM could significantly silence theexpression of the KRAS gene. In general,the HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM nanocomplex degraded quickly underredax environment to re-expose siR-93C@PAMAM,furtherPAMAM could facilitate the lysosomal escape of siR-93C viathe proton sponge" effect. The siRNA-based gene silencingwas activated in cancer cells,sif-g3C induced about 9C%knack-down of KRAS expression, significantly reduced cellviability. then inhibited proliferation of A549 cells, which wasshown by the cycle arrest and apoptosis results ishown inFigureS[A-C]).  
## 3.11.In vivo distribution  
To check the in vivo anti-turnor efficiency of HA-SeSe-COOHsiR-93C@PAMAM. different complexes with the same concen-tration of siR-93C-FAM was injected into tumor-bearing miceto investigate the in vivo distribution. As shown in Figure6iAl, though the siRNA fluarescence signal was observed inthe turnor tissue at 3h in siR-93CoLipo2000 group, extensivefluorescence signal was also detected in the whole badyuntil 12h),indicatingthatsiR-93CgLipo2000 didn't exhibitspecific tumor-targeting ability. In the siR93CePAMAMtreated group, the turnor tissue exhibited fluorescence signalfrom 6h till 9h. and it significantly reduced at 12h. It shouldbe noted that the accumulation of siR-93C@PAMAM in thelungs and kidneys was significantly higher than other organseven up to 12h after injection, indicated that siR-  
DRUGDEUVERY  
583  
93CePAMAM mainly passively accumulated in the tumorand distributed in the lung and kidney. On the other side.due to the positively charged property,siR-93CaPAMANMcould be easily captured and rapidly eliminated by reticuloendothelial system (RES) and exhibited short circulation timeafter intravenous administration. As expected, turnor signalin HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CDPAMAM group was initiallyobserved and accurnulated at 3h up to 12h Ifluorescenceintensity was still extremely high after 12 hj,which was dueto the active targeting and binding ability of HA to CD44ioverexpressed on A549 cells). At the same time, the protect-ive auter layer of HA-5eSe-COOH could allow complex a longer circulation time, consequently, increasing theaccurmulation within turmors (Ho et al.,2019].  
## 3.12. In vivo anticancer activity and safety evaiuation  
Figure 6(B) shows the turnor volune of different treatmentgroups, negligible effects on tumor fast growth wereobserved in the treatment with siR-93CeLipo200D comparewith saline group because of the limited bioavailability ofsiR-93CLipo2000.Excitingly,both siR-93CrPAMAM and HASeSe-COOH/siR-93CgPAMAM treated groups showed significant inhibition on turnor growth, with tumor yolume cansiderably smaller than the saline group andsiR-93C@Lipo2000treatedl group. After 21 days treatment, the tumors of nudemice were harvested to evaluate the tumor growth inhibitianeffect (in Figure G[C)I. It was found that the HA-SeSe-COOHsiR-93CPAMAM treated group showed the most remarkablesuppression effect, as the tumor volume inhibitory ratereached to approximately 74.0%, showing that HA-SeSeCOOH/siR-93CePAMAM could successfully inhibit the turmorgrowth.This result may be due to the efficient siRNA deliveryand transfection. In addition, there wwas no observed weightloss of nude mice during the animal study period in Figure6[D}.Furthermore, according to H&E stained tumor slicesimages (Figure 6(El), negligible level of necrotic cells wasobserved in saline and siR-93C@Lipo2000 treated mice.Incontrast, obvious necrosis and inflammation was observed inSiR-93CRPAMAMandHA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CaPAMAMtreated groups. this result was consistent with the inhibitoryeffect of A549 cells In wtro study.To further evaluate the in vivo safety of HA-SeSe-COOH  
siR-93CBPAMAM,the histalogical analysis of the main organswas perforrmed and shown in Figure 6IF1. No apparent tissuedamage was observed in saline and siR-93CDLipo2000treated groups, however, collapse or disappearance ofaveoli irregular alveclar shape and thickening of the alveolar septa were observed in siR-93C@PAMAM treated groupIndicating that the lungs of the siR-93CePAMAM treatedmice were severely damaged. Not only lung tissue but alsocertain level of kidney function was affected by siR93CePAMAM, some glomeruli were distorted or atrophied.tubular dilation and tubular epithelial cell necrosis and exfoliation were also observed. The major cause of the lung andkidney tissue damage was PAMAM. As mentioned above.PAMAM is cytotoxic due to its high density of positivecharge which was attributed to the large number of terminal

Taken together, it is notsurprising that siR-93CPAMAM would induce lung and kid-ney damoge. As a contrast, insignificant infiammation andnegliqible necrotic cells could be observed in HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CoPAMAM treated group, indicating that theouter layer HA-SeSe-COOH did significantly improve the biosafety of PAMAM  
## 4.Conclusion  
In summary, a redox-responsive siRNA targeted delivery vector, HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93GaPAMAM, was constructed andemployed as vector for KRAS siRN/A transfection. Due to thesuperb internalization via clathrin-depencent pathway andexcellent endosomal escape capability,HA-SeSeCOOH/SiR99CePAMAM exhibited favorable transfection efficiencyImportantly, HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CePAMAM could inducethe cell apoptosis and the cell cycle arrest at G1 phase

leading to efficient anti-proliferative effect in A549 cells.Meanwhile, migration and invasian of A549 cells was alsostrongly inhibited.In vivo studies showed that HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM targeted and accumulated at thetumor site, effectively suppressed tumor growth and signifl-cantly reduced the toxic side effects of PAMAM. Thus. HASeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM could potentially be used as aneffective carrier for siRNA delivery and transfection; it hasgreat potential as gene carriers in turnor therapy.
